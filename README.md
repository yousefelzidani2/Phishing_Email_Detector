# Phishing Email Detector "OopsHooked"


## Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly tool designed to detect phishing emails by analysing suspicious keywords, embedded links, and unusual formatting patterns. 
It calculates a confidence score for phishing likelihood and provides a visual summary.

## Tools and Materials Used
- Python: The primary programming language for building the project.
- Matplotlib: Used for visualising the results via bar charts. Note: Matplotlib builds a font cache during its first run, which can take a few moments.
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Processes and analyses email text, including identifying common words.
- Regex: Detects patterns like links in the email text.
- PyCharm: IDE for writing and testing Python code.

## Features
- Detects suspicious keywords (e.g., "urgent", "click here", "security alert").
- Counts and flags excessive use of links in emails.
- Identifies unusual formatting patterns (e.g., emails with too many links).
- Calculates a confidence score to determine phishing likelihood.
- Generates a bar chart to visually summarize the analysis.

## How to Run the Tool
1. Install Required Libraries:
   Run the following commands in your terminal to install necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk matplotlib
   ```

2. Run the Program:
   Open the project in PyCharm and run the `main.py` script.

3. Input Email Text:
   Replace the sample email text in the `email` variable within the code.

4. View Results:
   - Check the terminal output for analysis details (e.g., suspicious keywords, links found, confidence score).
   - View the bar chart (`sample_graph.png`) generated by the program.

## Challenges Faced
- Matplotlib Font Cache: During the first execution, Matplotlib builds a font cache, which may take a few seconds but ensures faster rendering in subsequent runs.
- Managing dependencies (e.g., ensuring `matplotlib` and `nltk` are correctly installed).

## Future Improvements
- Incorporating machine learning for enhanced phishing detection.
- Adding domain analysis for detecting fake senders.
- Building a web-based interface for easier usage.

## Sample Output
Below is an example bar chart generated by the program:
